# Tests
The Tests here are split into several files
## tests_models_parts.py
This is meant to handle tests dealing with the parts, master_parts, manufacturers, and suppliers.
The idea is that each part is a unique object of a master_part type.
Master_parts have a manufacture and a manufacturer part number, as well as multiple suppliers each with a supplier part number.

# User Story
